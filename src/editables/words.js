      Dot O is a Hip Hop artist born and raised in Houston Texas. Legal name is
      Kolawole Ogunleye meaning “Bring wealth to the family”. His ethnicity
      originates from the motherland of Nigeria where both of his parents are
      from, who immigrated to the states to have him and his siblings. He is the
      third out of four siblings.

    <p>
      Dot O has a conscious, soulful, lyrical approach blended into his Hip Hop;
      Inspired by greats such as Tupac Amaru Shakur, Christopher Wallace, Sean
      Carter, Kanye West, Sade Adu and many more.{" "}
    </p>
    <p>
      Music has always been imprinted on his heart. He picked up his writing pen
      at elementary school due to class assignments unexpectedly. School is
      usually seen as a limiter by other artist but not for Dot O. It became a
      creative outlet that he could turn both good and bad. Only those who were
      close were aware of this gift. It wasn’t until 2014 as a student at the
      University of Texas at San Antonio did Dot O come out publicly with his
      passion. He created projects for the people, participated in performances
      from other entities as well as his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      The growth of Dot O is a continual life journey. He carries his listeners
      along as he finds himself emotionally and spiritually. His music
      illuminates his perspective on life, societal norms, history, and his
      personal opinions on the best way to approach life’s hardships. His
      lyrical content is straight to the point and evasive at the same time. He
      wants you to think when you listen and be able to relate to the subject of
      each song he creates.
    </p>
    <p>
      He enjoys reading mind forming texts ranging from history, religion and
      nonfiction. This helps his self discovery learning, strengthening his
      weaknesses to be a better version of himself. Health of the body is also
      important to Dot O so multiple trips to the gym is a must. He will tell
      you that he is very good at pool, and will challenge you to a game if the
      opportunity presents itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      He is hopeful in the growth of his music, openness about his personal life
      & thought process and escalating activism for his people. All of his
      achievements were possible only through God’s grace, in addition to
      support from friends, family and chance encounters. He aims to make a
      change with his music for the current generation, the younger generation,
      and the generations to come.
